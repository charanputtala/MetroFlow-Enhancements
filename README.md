# MetroFlow Enhancements

**MetroFlow Enhancements** is a data-driven initiative aimed at improving the efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of Metro services. This project leverages various data analytics techniques to optimize metro operations, focusing on real-time scheduling adjustments and operational improvements, even in the absence of explicit passenger count data.

## Project Description

MetroFlow Enhancements utilizes existing metro operation data to make informed decisions that enhance service delivery. By analyzing various data points, such as train arrival and departure times, passenger flow patterns, and historical performance metrics, the project identifies areas where operational adjustments can lead to significant improvements.

### Key Features

- **Data Loading and Overview**: Load and explore various metro operation data files, including agency, calendar, routes, shapes, stop times, stops, and trips.
- **Geographical Visualization**: Plot geographical paths of different metro routes to visualize coverage areas.
- **Trip Scheduling Analysis**: Analyze the frequency and scheduling of trips across different days of the week.
- **Real-Time Scheduling Adjustments**: Implement dynamic adjustments to schedules based on real-time data to minimize delays and reduce congestion.
- **Passenger Load Estimation**: Estimate passenger loads and identify trends using indirect indicators like ticket sales and entry/exit data.
- **Operational Efficiency Improvements**: Adjust the number of trips during peak and off-peak hours to better align service levels with inferred demand.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
